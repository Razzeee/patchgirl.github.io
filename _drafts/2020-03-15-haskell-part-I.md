Howdy,<br/>
This post is part of the series [building a web app with functional programming languages][building-a-web-app-with-fp] and is the sequel to the Elm [part][elm-part-I].

Haskell was used to write the API that backs [patchgirl.io](https://patchgirl.io), a web app rest client.
This post talks about my feedback with Haskell on this project and wether I consider it [production ready][production-ready].

# Introduction

Before building Patchgirl, I wasn't a Haskell beginner. I have played with it before (never professionally) and done some Scala professionally.
This post will focus mainly on Haskell downsides.
Haskell is great, powerful, fascinating and exciting. Haskell represents why I love my job and found our industry one of the best in term of self improvement.
That being said, Haskell has its flaws and this post will focus mainly on them.


# Architecture

- mtl
- free/extensible effects

## Community

- great, helpful

# Convention and best practices

- style guide
- architecture

# Learning resources

- sparse
- scattered
- no official guide

## Documentation

- there are none
- use github and read other people's source code

## technical flaws

- record
- right to left read

## Learn by experimenting

- really steep learning curve
- time/effort investment is huge
- is this lib/technology worth it ? just test it !
- return on investment is also huge (but there's a cost)

## research lang

# And the ugly

- overloaded

# Conclusion

## Learn and improve

- you'll improve your programming skills so much
- you'll learn so many fascinating concepts (Monad, Functor, pure functions, composition,...)
- you'll learn how to modelize better a problem and its solution

## Production ready ?

- noooo

## So should I use it ?

- yessss
